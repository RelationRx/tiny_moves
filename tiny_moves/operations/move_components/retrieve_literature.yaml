  === Tool Use ===
  - Use the tool available to you to search a vector database of scientific reports
  - Construct FOCUSED queries based on particular biological processes in the hypothesis
  - Ensure your queries are full natural language sentences.
  - Each query should be SPECIFIC to a part of the current hypothesis and NOT too general.
